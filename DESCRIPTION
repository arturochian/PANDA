Description: PANDA (Preferential Attachment based common Neighbor Distribution derived Associations) is designed to perform the following tasks in PPI networks: (1) identify significantly functionally associated protein pairs, (2) predict GO terms and KEGG pathways for proteins, (3) make a cluster of proteins based on the significant protein pairs, (4) identify subclusters whose members are enriched in KEGG pathways. For other types of biological networks, (1) and (3) can still be performed.
